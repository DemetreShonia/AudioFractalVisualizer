# AudioFractalVisualizer
This is a project where I learned many things about shader writing! It turned out really cool and suggest to download and play with it (It looks much better when animate, trust me!)

I made two fractal visualizer. Each has multiple buttons to modify how they look or move.

Quaternion Mandelbrot:

Mandelbulb (It is animating in this frame):

Note: The original project was damaged but fortunately I have the latest build which you can download and test! This repository only has mandelbulb in it.
