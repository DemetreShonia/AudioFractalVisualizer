# AudioFractalVisualizer
This is a project where I learned many things about shader writing! It turned out really cool and suggest to download and play with it.

I made two fractal visualizer. Each has multiple buttons to modify how they look or move.

Quaternion Mandelbrot:

Mandelbulb comes with audio section. There you have 3 options:
Clap - When it is on, your clap will randomize looks of mandelbulb.
Voice - Yor voice changes brightness of color depending on how loud sound was.
Music - There is a music in build and mandelbulb reacts on it changing color tint!

Note: The original project was damaged but fortunately I have the latest build which you can download and test! This repository only has mandelbulb in it.
